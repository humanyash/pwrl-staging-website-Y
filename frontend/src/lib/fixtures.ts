    "There can be no assurance that PWRL investment objectives will be achieved. An investment in PWRL is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. PWRL is designed as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle. Investors could lose some or all of their investment. Past performance is not indicative of future results. An investment in PWRL is speculative and involves a high degree of risk with substantial risk of loss. Shares of closed-end funds such as PWRL frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. Before making an investment decision, a prospective investor should (i) consider the suitability of this investment with respect to the investor’s investment objectives and (ii) consider factors such as the investor’s investment goals, income, risk tolerance, and time horizon.",
    "Closed-end funds differ from open-end funds in that closed-end funds do not redeem their shares at the request of an investor. No shareholder has the right to require PWRL to redeem his, her or its shares. While Powerlaw’s shares are expected to be listed on an exchange, an active public market for the shares may not develop. As a result, shareholders may not be able to liquidate their investment. Accordingly, shareholders should consider that they may not have access to the funds they invest in PWRL for an indefinite period of time. There is no assurance that PWRL will achieve its investment objective, or that the private companies in which PWRL invests will ever have a liquidity event.",

Due to various risks and uncertainties, actual events or results of actual performance of an investment may differ materially from those reflected or contemplated in such forward-looking statements, which speak only of the date they are made, and there is no guarantee that these opinions or predictions will ultimately be realized. As a result, investors should not rely on such forward-looking statements in making their investment decisions. Any projection of the performance discussed by Powerlaw is highly speculative and represents Powerlaw’s opinion, which may change.
